            "p": "Finning Aberdeen was a progression from Caledonian Tractors who were the original CAT dealers for Scotland. Original coverage for the northeast was from the Fishing port of Fraserburgh. CAT Engines had revolutionised fishing safety and vessels could now safely go to sea and return again and again under there own steam. Believe it or not until CAT engines were installed on these vessels’ reliability was very poor and trips were short. It was common for boats to be brought in by either there fishing mate or the RNLI. This new dependability enabled the fishing boats to travel further for longer and as such the sizes of vessel increased. Aberdeen was now the harbour of choice to land these bigger catches. Some pictures of the original Branch at Aberdeen albert quay attached, however this branch was quickly too small. A purpose built to “CAT guidance” facility was built (Believe it or not CAT have descriptions and designs for how a branch should be laid out in SIS). It was opened on the 17th October 1980 by the then President of the Scottish Fisherman’s Federation. At the time it was supporting construction heavily with all the oil and gas pipeline works, Oil and gas and of course Marine. As it stands this branch is presently in its 40th years of proud service."

The building is relatively new, it was purpose built approx. 20 years ago, previously, we were based on the outskirts of Cardiff, at a site that most recognised at Culverhouse Cross, a fabricated building with an office block attached to the front end, a very basic but functional building that was quite an impressive size at the time. At the front-end section was a huge sign showing the name BOWMAKER who were the named dealers at the time before merging into the FINNING family. The building became outdated and aged, along with a lot of the internal infrastructure, overhead cranes in the workshop, offices, all showed their age, so when we first visited the new site based in Llantrisant it definitely had the Wow factor, light spacious work areas, all fully air conditioned, state of the art double overhead cranes in the main workshop plus an independent overhead crane in the specialist rebuild area, transmission and engine bays. The workshop is split into two sections, the main machine repair section incorporates five repair bays, with a separate transmission and engine bay. The transmission bay boasts a fully operational test bed. The engine repair section has three dedicated bays for this purpose. A dedicated section for hydraulic cylinder repairs is available, where we have two repair beds, one for the smaller cylinders and a separate one for the more larger cylinders, there is also a fully functioning FHS (Finning Hose Service) available to customers, either attending the branch to be made up or the option of three mobile engineers. The site also includes a parts warehouse and parts department, integrated offices, works canteen and meeting rooms, again all fully Air Conditioned. Interestingly, the then Finning workforce were used in the move from Culverhouse Cross too Llantrisant, with the help of a local transport & logistics company. The very first machine into our workshop on the same weekend, incidentally, was a Caterpillar D8 owned by one of our largest customers, Walters Plant."

Several thousand tonnes of coal were removed from under the development to offset the build costs. Bowmaker Plant owned this and surrounding land for many years before the build. The maximum capacity design was based on being able to take a 777 in the main workshop bottom doors and in the paint shop a 777 with the skip raised (hence the height), as part of a flexible floor plan. At design time we were still the Cat Lift Truck dealer which produced the small bay which had the 8 tonne ramp in it. The left had smaller part of the workshop was designed as the component rebuild section. And backed onto that was the self-contained stores."
